    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a web developer with a logical mindset with a behavior of solving problems
        for others. I find difficult to crame and memorize topics for a long period of time 
        which is why I did not opt for a medical career. I live in Karachi and my current mode of 
        learning new skills through Udemy.
